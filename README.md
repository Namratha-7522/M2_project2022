DC SERVO MOTOR CONTROLLER


This is a port of the very sophisticated DC Servomotor Controller SMC3 for the ATmega328.

It includes the results of a detailed analysis of the inner workings of the source code and (hopefully) more beginner-friendly explanation of the meaning of the control parameter and how to choose sensible values for the desired application.

This analysis includes a full translation of the assembler code into C code. This was started as a tool to understand the inner workings of SMC3 but it is turning into a full project of its own right now.
